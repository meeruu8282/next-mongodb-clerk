## Introduction

This is a groundbreaking healthcare application that simplifies the process for healthcare providers to connect with patients and offer their services. The app serves as a platform to bridge the gap between healthcare seekers and healthcare providers.

## Features

List the key features of your project:

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.


## Typeform

To find and edit the Typeform page in your code, follow these steps:

Open the file /C:/Users/GTSA - Infinity/Documents/Projekt/Portfolio/providerpage/src/app/page.tsx in your code editor.

Locate the line where the Typeform ID is defined:

The Typeform ID is set to 'JlurNqyg' in this example. You can replace this ID with your own Typeform ID. To do this, go to the Typeform website (https://www.typeform.com/) and log in to your account.

Once logged in, select the Typeform you want to use or create a new one.

In the Typeform editor, click on the "Share" tab.

Under the "Share your typeform" section, you will find the Typeform ID. It is a combination of letters and numbers.

Copy the Typeform ID.

Go back to your code editor and replace 'JlurNqyg' with the copied Typeform ID:

Save the file.

Now, when you run your application, the Typeform with the specified ID will be displayed on the page. Any changes you make to the Typeform on the Typeform website will be reflected in your application.
